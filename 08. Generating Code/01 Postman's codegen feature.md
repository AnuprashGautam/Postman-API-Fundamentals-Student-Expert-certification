### __Postman's Codegen Feature__

Postman can help you integrate API calls into your applications by generating code snippets in various coding languages.

#### __Generating Code Snippets__

- **Access Code Generation**: Every request you make has a code generation tab accessible from the code `</>` icon in the far right.
- **Select Language**: Once the code snippet generator pane is open, you can select from a dropdown to generate the API request in common coding languages like Python, JavaScript, C, NodeJS, and more.
- **Example**: Generate the `GET /books` request in cURL syntax. Copy this snippet into the terminal and press Enter to make the API call and print the response body.

This feature allows you to easily integrate API calls into your applications, giving them superpowers with APIs! ðŸš€
