### __Task: Create a Workspace__

Are you ready to become a digital librarian using the Postman Library API v2? This REST API allows you to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) books in a public library database. You will use Postman to interact with this API and manage books.

Remember to follow along because you must submit your Postman Workspace later to complete this course.

#### __Steps to Create a Workspace__

1. **Open Postman for web**: Postman can be used as a desktop app or web browser. This course will show you how to use it in the browser.
   - Navigate to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
   - Sign in if you have an account, or sign up for free!

2. **Create a Workspace**: To start making Postman requests, you need to be inside a workspace. Let's make one!
   - Workspaces dropdown > Create Workspace
   - Select Blank Workspace as Template and Name your workspace "Postman API Fundamentals Student Expert"
   - Set the visibility to Only me - Personal. Then click "Create Workspace."

Success! Welcome to your empty new workspace. Next, we'll learn how to add our first Collection to the workspace.
