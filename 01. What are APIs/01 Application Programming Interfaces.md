### Application Programming Interfaces

**Definition**: An API is a contract that allows code to talk to other code. APIs are the building blocks of modern software because they allow for sharing of resources and services across applications, organizations, and devices.

**Examples**: Making a payment on a website, checking the weather on a mobile app, using Google Maps inside another app.

### Why are APIs important?

**Integration**: APIs help developers integrate exciting features and build automation without reinventing the wheel (e.g., using a Weather API instead of launching your weather balloons).

**Innovation**: APIs allow enterprises to open up their product for faster innovation (e.g., apps that interact with Twitter or Meta APIs by posting on your behalf or reading tweets).

**Products**: APIs can be products themselves, like SaaS products such as Stripe's payment APIs or Twilio's text messaging and email APIs.

### Who works with APIs?

**Not just for developers**: According to Postman's latest State of the API Report, almost half of the survey respondents identified as holding non-developer roles, such as management, solutions architects, business and data analysts, educators, and researchers. All these roles benefit from the standardized data access provided by APIs.

**Industries**: API use is not limited to the tech and IT industries. Survey responses in the same report show that while tech, business, IT, and banking sectors represent the bulk of API use, any industry can benefit from the convenience provided by APIs.

### Who benefits from APIs?

**Efficiency**: Ultimately, everyone benefits from APIs either directly or indirectly because APIs make processes more efficient and connect the services we love and rely on.
